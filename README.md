# Getting Started

## Intro

Hello and welcome, I'm so excited that you're embarking on this journey of becoming a developer!

## Setting the Scene

The contents of this is to prepare you to make your own first front end react application. As such it is focused on the practical aspects of this and not so much of how things are working "under the hood".

The contents of this is to help you to facilitate your own learning, no one will be checking/ grading your work (you can always ask for help though!). To help you achieve this, my cheif encouragment for you is:

> **Be curious!**

Wonder how else the code could be used? Thought of a edge case that may break the code? Want to combine some code together to see what happens? Try it all!!!

It is almost certain that you will **not** be able to complete each section in the recomended time (Apart from the set up). If that happens, I would ask you to move on to the next section anyway so that you get to give everything a go! (You can always come back to it once you've completed all the sections)
